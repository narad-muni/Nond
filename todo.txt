tasks

register
invoice
scheduler

subscribed services by client (dummy added)

add default columns to client

pre curated task templates

doubts

will one service only have one register. - narration

is narration in invoice auto generated. - yes, can be modified later on

create task scheduler based on client rather than register

can move from monthly to quaterly and vv
register will remain same, task scheduling will change

on entry on specific columns, services will be automatically subscribed

add linked fields to registers with popup to verify

cron job to move register to new financial year

create bill from task screen

bill based on services

bulk billing

created bills by default will have service names as descriptions which can be changed

invoice page will have pending amount etc

billing page will include services, one time tasks, parent company

billing will have option to transfer bill to another company

rename parent to group v

Tasks will be service based
