download option fix

create task in client

starting with register

add hsn/sac in service
2 type of bills gst & non-gst

scheduler - 
    run scheduler
    *doubt - when to delete tasks - delete after 2 1 year, archive when billed and completed

*****delete client releated data when client is deleted
handle delete cascade

clients -> tasks?, scheudlers, register-entry?,  

------------

add default columns to client


register master will list all registers e.g. gst-22-23, gst-21-22 
it can create new register with new master or rotate active registers, archive active registers.
deleting or archiving active registers will delete the template and master register entry, it will keep archived registers

*** there is issue on calculating columns for archived registers, need new schema

soln - create new tempalte for every master, maintains version

add retention strategy and rotation period, date in register master

archived registers cannot be rotated, only deleted
